# Examples using the Lilygo T-Display S3 Development Board

Code examples using the _ESP32-S3 1.9 inch ST7789 LCD Display Development Board_ [as available on Lilygo's website here](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-display-s3). Note, this is for the non-touch version.

Note that these examples use a customized version of the "TFT_eSPI" library, included in the source. This was copied from [Lilygo's examples for this board on GitHub](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Display-S3).

## Notes aobut the Particles Example

The 7000 particles example was "manually forked" from the following GitHub repo:
https://github.com/doctorpartlow/esp32s3lilygoanimations/blob/main/particles.ino

I only applied a couple minor bug fixes, optimizations, and formatting.

Here is a Youtube video posted by the original author of the their "7000 non normalized particles on the esp32-s3 t-display from lilygo" code:
